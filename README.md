Truly one of the most fun projects I have worked on during my graduate studies, this project uses the data from the aita subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) and analysis the conversational posts of an Opinion Provider (the original story teller) and the Challengers of the opinion (the ones who judge opinion provider's story) and classifies whether the OP’s responses to the Challenger are ‘excuses for his/her behavior’, ‘complementary information supporting his/her opinion’ or neither. In addition to multi-classification, this project at its core explores the interesting relation between paired sentences set in a context and is loosely based on the ideas of Sentence Pair Modeling.

This repository contains 4 components:

Task_instructions: This document loosely defines the problem statement for this task, along with some implementational constraints to adhere to.
Assignment_P2_Codes: A well-commented python code that walks through different steps delineated int he report.
Assignment_P2_Report: A report re-iterating the problem statement, delineating different implementation steps and final results obtained from codes.
P2 AITA_Combined: The dataset used for this task.
